On December 2nd, 2009, I talked in Geneva on [iPhone Privacy](http://seriot.ch/resources/talks_papers/iPhonePrivacy.pdf). I called the following Apple claim into question:

> Applications on the device are "sandboxed" so they cannot access data stored by other applications.

> In addition, system files, resources, and the kernel are shielded from the user's application space.

> Source: [iPhone in Business - Security Overview](http://images.apple.com/iphone/business/docs/iPhone_Security_Overview.pdf)

SpyPhone demoes it is not exactly true. It shows the kind of data a rogue application can collect in a non jailbroken iPhone.

These data do certainly interest marketers, spammers, thieves, competitors and law enforcement officials.
